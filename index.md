## Overview
Low vision can affect anyone at any age and it includes different degrees of sight loss from having blind spots, poor night vision, and problems with glare to almost a complete 
loss of sight, and cannot normally be treated. Peripheral vision loss is one of the main visual field’s problems where patients can see through their central area only in a way 
that makes their daily life activities such as driving and crossing the road very hard.
